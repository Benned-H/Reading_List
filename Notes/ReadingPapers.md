## 1. How to read a research paper

If you're assigned in a class or asked to review a paper, the full process can take several hours. These are some initial guidelines:

* *Read critically* - No author is infallible. Are they solving the right problem? Are there simpler solutions or limitations of theirs? Are their assumptions logical?
* *Read creatively* - It's far easier to criticize than to create. What good ideas are there and what improvements would you take as next steps?
* Make notes as you read: Many people cover the margins with notes, but however you do it make sure to write down questions or criticisms. *Underline key points* and mark key data for future passes.
* After a first read-through, *attempt to summarize* the paper in one or two sentences. Good papers answer specific questions. If summarizing proves easy, try to summarize the most important subpoints as well.
* *Compare the paper* to other works. What has been contributed and what previous ideas were utilized?

In writing up a review, include the one to two sentence summary, a more extensive outline of the main points (assumptions made, arguments, data, conclusions), any limitations of the ideas in the paper, and my overall opinion of the paper: quality of ideas and potential impact.

## 2. How to Read a Paper
#### By S. Keshav

This outlines a three-pass method to reading papers.

We may need to read papers for conferences or classes, to keep current, or for a literature survey. 'A typical researcher will likely spend hundreds of hours every year
reading papers.' This skill will thus be important.

**The Three-Pass Approach** - Read the paper in up to three passes instead of plowing beginning-to-end. Each pass has a specific goal:

1. Get a general idea of the paper.
2. Grasp the paper's content, not details.
3. Understand the paper in depth.

**First pass** - Quick scan of the paper for a bird's-eye view. Take 5-10 minutes to:

1. Carefully read title, abstract, and intro.
2. Read section and sub-section headings only.
3. Glance at math content to determine theoretical foundations.
4. Read conclusions.
5. Glance over references: What have you seen?

Try to answer these *five Cs*:

1. Category - What kind of paper is this? (measurement, analysis of existing system, description of prototype...)
2. Context - What's this related to? What bases were used?
3. Correctness - Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
4. Contributions - What does this contribute?
5. Clarity - Is it well written?

With this knowledge, is the paper worth reading further? Save the paper. When you write a paper, this pass may be all your work receives. Choose sections titles coherently and consider a graphical abstract.

**Second pass** - Read with greater care, skipping only proofs. Jot notes at this point. Note questions and unknown terms.

1. Look at figures - Are they labeled well? Do results have error bars?
2. Mark relevant unread references.

This pass should take up to an hour once you have experience doing it. Write up a summary with supporting evidence. If you still don't understand the paper, it may be expertise or poor writing. You can set the paper aside in defeat, return later after background reading, or persevere into the third pass.

**Third pass** - Required for full understanding. Virtually re-implement the paper with the same assumptions. Use this to evaluate the innovations and hidden failings.

Identify and challenge every assumption made. Think about how you'd present the ideas and consider future work. This pass may take many hours, and even 1-2 hours for an experience reader.

Test: Reconstruct the paper's structure from memory.

**Doing a Literature Survey** - This will test your reading skills. Start by using an academic engine and well-chosen keywords. Find 3-5 *highly cited* papers in the area. One pass on each, read related work sections. If they give you a survey, you're done. If not, identify shared citations and repeated names. Download these key papers. See what the key publishers have done recently, checking which conferences are common. Then go to these conferences' sites, look through proceedings, and find high-quality work.

Two-pass everything you have so far, read any new key papers you find, and iterate as necessary.

## 3. How to (seriously) read a scientific paper
**By Elisabeth Pain**

This surveyed a dozen scientists from various fields and ages.

*Approaching papers*

* Identify 1-2 key figures and try to parse what's going on.
* By reading the abstract and conclusions, we can see if the goal was reached. Also concentrate on what you want to get out of the paper: compare results, find context, or extensions of new data.
* If the work is similar to yours, what can you learn from their method? Why do aspects differ and why did the authors make those decisions?
* The introduction should frame the question - Is it one you want to see answered?
* Who aren't the authors referencing? What aspects of the research are they ignoring?
* If you're reading for background information, save key sentences and questions/ideas so you don't need to re-read the overall paper.
* Compare methodologies in a spreadsheet.
* Results/methods are where you should be most critical. If you know the field, jump to these two.
* Most important things are things that change your thinking or give new ideas/directions.
* Introduction/discussion are crucial if you don't know the field.
* Intro-figures-results seem like a barebones strategy if you know nothing about the field.
* Conclusions and methods is the minimum if you're an expert.

*If you don't understand something*

* Quick Google if it's a little, but if you're struggling find a review article or textbook chapter.
* Terminology can be jargon, but methods are always crucial.
* If you have time, following the rabbithole of not knowing X... "X influences Y... What's Y?" can provide insight into how things are connected.
* What question are they trying to answer? is fundamental even if jargon clouds the paper.
* Ask colleagues or directly authors if pressed for time.
* Only search jargon if it influences what you want to get out of the paper.

*Dealing with feeling overwhelmed*

* If a paper's relevant to a problem I want to solve, confusion is an opportunity to learn. Some writing's just terrible and not worth it.
* Teamwork can help in really daunting papers.
* It's ok to not finish something if it's truly impossible...

*Final tips*

* If something's seminal and you want to understand it, find a way to give a presentation of it. Answering questions and summarizing will help.
* Reference manager - Mendeley
* You need to build a mental library and after a while new papers will slot in and understanding their contributions will be easier.
* Wikipedia and blog posts are fair game for intorductory definitions.
* Ask for help. More experienced scientists learn by explaining too.
* Keep your notes handy and include relevant figures plus citation information.
